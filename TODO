TODO:
Fix existing bugs in /promote and /demote
Add toggles to all features
If vminecraft.properties doesn't exist make it be written and include default settings
Refine messages when admins use commands --Ready for testing
Change loading to happen when the plugin loads instead of having to wait for a player to speak
Change everything else in settings to be a string like rules instead of booleans

Ideas:
Mass teleport command
A personal muting system for players
