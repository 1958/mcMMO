TODO:
Improve logging
Fix existing bugs in /promote and /demote
Add toggles to all features
Finish txtfiles.java so we can toggle features
Add more info if I can think of anything useful to /whois and format it more nicely with linebreaks and stuff
Maybe include a "last online" feature for /whois
Look into block protection
